# kms-intermediate-rotator: the rotation Lambda

An AWS Secrets Manager rotation Lambda that keeps a name-constrained
intermediate CA, signed by an AWS KMS key, in a secret. The root CA's private
key stays in KMS. On each rotation the Lambda generates a new intermediate
key, builds the intermediate certificate from its own configuration, has KMS
sign it, and stores certificate, key and root in the secret in the
[`intermediate-ca/v1` format](secret-format.md). Whatever consumes the
intermediate reads the secret's `AWSCURRENT` version; the rotator knows
nothing about it.

It runs on the `provided.al2023` custom runtime, arm64 or x86_64, as the
executable `bootstrap`.

## Rotation flow

Secrets Manager invokes the function four times per rotation, with
`{"SecretId", "ClientRequestToken", "Step"}` and, when the function rotates
through an assumed role or across accounts, a `RotationToken`, which is passed
on to `PutSecretValue` (and never logged). Before every step, as the AWS
rotation templates do, the function checks that the secret is in its
configuration (by full ARN; a `SecretId` given as a name is resolved with
`DescribeSecret`), that rotation is enabled on it and that the token is one of
its versions. If that version is already `AWSCURRENT` the step succeeds and
does nothing; if it is not `AWSPENDING` the step fails.

1. **createSecret**: if the `AWSPENDING` version of the token already has a
   value (a retry), it returns without signing again. Otherwise it generates a
   key, builds the certificate from the secret's configuration, signs it with
   KMS (`Sign`, `MessageType: DIGEST`, on the key ARN `GetPublicKey` resolved
   `kms_key_id` to at start), checks the signature against the root and that
   a chain as deep as its path length allows verifies, and writes the secret
   with `PutSecretValue` (the token, `VersionStages: [AWSPENDING]`). If a
   concurrent invocation for the same token stored its version first, that
   one is kept and the step succeeds.
2. **setSecret**: nothing; there is no service to configure.
3. **testSecret**: reads `AWSPENDING` and checks it as a reader would (the
   format's `Decode`: schema, key matches cert, cert is a CA and verifies to
   the root), that its root is the configured one, that subject, basic
   constraints, path length, key usage, name constraints and key type equal
   the configuration, that a throwaway chain as deep as its path length
   allows (sub-CAs and a leaf, made in memory) verifies to the root, and its
   lifetime:
   - measured from its issuance (`NotBefore` + 5m), it was given the
     configured `validity` (or up to the root's `NotAfter`, if sooner);
   - it has at least `min_remaining` (default half the validity) left now.

   So a rotation retried days later with the same `AWSPENDING` version still
   passes, and one whose pending version is mostly used up fails (see
   [Recovering a stuck rotation](#recovering-a-stuck-rotation)).

   A `testSecret` with nothing to test (the token is not a version of the
   secret, or its `AWSPENDING` version has no value) is the configuration test
   Secrets Manager runs when rotation is set up without rotating immediately:
   it succeeds, since the configuration and the KMS key were checked at start,
   and is logged as a configuration test. A pending version with a value is
   always tested in full.
4. **finishSecret**: moves `AWSCURRENT` to the token with
   `UpdateSecretVersionStage`, removing it from the version that had it
   (Secrets Manager then labels that one `AWSPREVIOUS`).

At cold start, before serving anything, the function loads its configuration
and calls KMS `GetPublicKey`: if the key's public key is not the configured
root certificate's, it refuses to start.

## The certificate

Nothing in it comes from the event; everything comes from the configuration:

- the configured subject; a random positive 128-bit serial number;
- `NotBefore` = now − 5m, `NotAfter` = now + `validity`, never after the
  root's `NotAfter`;
- basic constraints `CA:TRUE` with the configured path length (0 included),
  critical; key usage `keyCertSign | cRLSign`, critical;
- name constraints, critical, when any are configured: permitted and excluded
  URI domains and DNS domains (see below);
- subject key identifier = SHA-1 of the new public key (RFC 5280 method 1);
  authority key identifier = the root's subject key identifier.

What it writes (informative; the format is the contract): `cert` is issued
directly by the root, so `chain` is always `""`; `root` is the configured
`root_certificate`, re-encoded from its DER; `key` is a newly generated key of
the configured `key_type`, which exists only in the Lambda's memory and in the
secret; the JSON is what `intermediateca.Encode` writes.

For SPIRE, keep `max_path_len` at 1 or more: SPIRE's own CA is a CA below the
intermediate, and the plugin refuses an intermediate that cannot sign one.

### Name constraints: verifiers differ

A domain without a leading dot does not mean the same everywhere:

| Constraint | Go `crypto/x509` (URI and DNS) | RFC 5280, OpenSSL, BoringSSL (URI) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `example.org` | `example.org` **and every host below it** | `example.org` only |
| `.example.org` | hosts below `example.org`, not `example.org` | hosts below `example.org` |

So `permitted_uri_domains: ["example.org"]` alone lets a Go verifier accept
`spiffe://sub.example.org`. To allow exactly one host (a SPIFFE trust domain,
for instance) in every stack, pair the two:

```json
"name_constraints": {
  "permitted_uri_domains": ["example.org"],
  "excluded_uri_domains": [".example.org"]
}
```

For DNS constraints all of them read `example.org` as the domain and its
subdomains. [verifiers/RESULTS.md](../verifiers/RESULTS.md) records what Envoy,
MySQL, Kafka and Go actually enforce.

### Path length and the root

The intermediate is one CA below the root. At start the configuration is
refused if the root's path length is 0, if a secret's `max_path_len` does not
fit under it (`max_path_len` ≤ root path length − 1), or if the root has a key
usage without `keyCertSign`. createSecret and testSecret also verify a chain
of the full depth, so an intermediate whose chains could not verify is never
promoted.

### The root's expiry

`NotAfter` is capped at the root's, and testSecret wants `min_remaining` left,
so rotation starts to fail once the root has less than `min_remaining` left:
the current intermediate stays in place and keeps working until it expires.
Alarm on rotation failures and renew the root before then.

## Rotator configuration

Exactly one of these environment variables must be set:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `ROTATOR_CONFIG` | the configuration, inline JSON |
| `ROTATOR_CONFIG_PARAMETER` | the name of an SSM parameter (`String` or `SecureString`) holding it, read once per cold start |

The configuration is the protobuf JSON of `Config` in
[config/v1/config.proto](../config/v1/config.proto), which is its reference:
every field, its default and its rules are there.

```json
{
  "kms_key_id": "alias/example-root",
  "root_certificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n",
  "signing_algorithm": "",
  "secrets": {
    "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:111122223333:secret:example-AbCdEf": {
      "subject": {"common_name": "Example Intermediate CA", "organization": ["Example"], "country": ["US"]},
      "key_type": "ec-p256",
      "validity": "2160h",
      "min_remaining": "1080h",
      "max_path_len": 1,
      "name_constraints": {
        "permitted_uri_domains": ["example.org"],
        "excluded_uri_domains": [],
        "permitted_dns_domains": [".example.org"],
        "excluded_dns_domains": []
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Meaning | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kms_key_id` | the root's KMS key: key ID, key ARN, alias name (`alias/...`) or alias ARN; an asymmetric `SIGN_VERIFY` key | required |
| `root_certificate` | the root certificate: exactly one PEM `CERTIFICATE` block, nothing before or after it, at most 16 KiB; its public key must be the KMS key's | required |
| `signing_algorithm` | a KMS signing algorithm (`ECDSA_SHA_256`, `ECDSA_SHA_384`, `ECDSA_SHA_512`, `RSASSA_PKCS1_V1_5_SHA_*`, `RSASSA_PSS_SHA_*`) | from the key spec: `ECC_NIST_P256` → `ECDSA_SHA_256`, `ECC_NIST_P384` → `ECDSA_SHA_384`, `ECC_NIST_P521` → `ECDSA_SHA_512`, `RSA_*` → `RSASSA_PKCS1_V1_5_SHA_256` |
| `secrets` | per secret, by ARN (`arn:<partition>:secretsmanager:<region>:<account>:secret:<name>`): what to issue (a `SecretProfile`). Use the full ARN (with the six random characters Secrets Manager appends) or the ARN without them. An event for any other secret fails. | at least one |
| `subject` | `common_name` (required, at most 64 characters), `organization`, `organizational_unit`, `country`, `province`, `locality` | required |
| `key_type` | the intermediate's key: `ec-p256`, `ec-p384`, `rsa-2048`, `rsa-4096` | `ec-p256` |
| `validity` | a Go duration string of `h`, `m`, `s`, `ms`, `us`, `ns` (`"2160h"`, `"1.5h"`, `"2h30m"`), positive | `2160h` (90 days) |
| `min_remaining` | a duration like `validity`: the least validity a pending intermediate must have left for testSecret to promote it; at most `validity` | half of `validity` |
| `max_path_len` | path length constraint, 0 to 8, and at most the root's path length − 1 | `1` |
| `name_constraints` | `permitted_uri_domains`, `excluded_uri_domains`, `permitted_dns_domains`, `excluded_dns_domains`: host names, each optionally with a leading dot (no scheme, port, path or wildcard), at most 64 per list | none |

An empty string is the same as a missing field. Unknown fields are errors, at
every level, so a misspelt setting does not go unnoticed; protobuf JSON also
accepts each field's lowerCamelCase name (`kmsKeyId`). The checks run in this
order, and the first that fails stops the Lambda from starting: the JSON
against the schema (unknown fields, types), the schema's rules
(protovalidate), then the ones a schema cannot express: the root certificate
parses and is a CA that may sign certificates and issue an intermediate
(`keyCertSign`, a path length other than 0), each `max_path_len` fits under
it, and, at start, the KMS key's public key is the root's. No error contains
the certificate.

## Recovering a stuck rotation

A version's value cannot change, and Secrets Manager retries a failed rotation
with the same `AWSPENDING` version. When testSecret rejects that value (too
little validity left, a root that is no longer the configured one, a
configuration changed since it was issued), every retry fails the same way,
and the error says so. Take the label off the version, and the next rotation
starts afresh with a new token:

```bash
aws secretsmanager update-secret-version-stage \
  --secret-id arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:111122223333:secret:example-AbCdEf \
  --version-stage AWSPENDING \
  --remove-from-version-id <the version in the error>
aws secretsmanager rotate-secret \
  --secret-id arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:111122223333:secret:example-AbCdEf
```

`AWSCURRENT` is untouched throughout: readers keep the current intermediate.

## Rotator IAM permissions

The Lambda's execution role needs:

| Actions | Resource |
| --- | --- |
| `kms:GetPublicKey`, `kms:Sign` | the root KMS key (by key ARN; IAM does not match aliases) |
| `secretsmanager:DescribeSecret`, `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue`, `secretsmanager:PutSecretValue`, `secretsmanager:UpdateSecretVersionStage` | the rotated secrets |
| `kms:Decrypt`, `kms:GenerateDataKey` (Encrypt) | the KMS key the secrets are encrypted with, when it is a customer managed key |
| `ssm:GetParameter` | the configuration parameter, with `ROTATOR_CONFIG_PARAMETER` only |
| `kms:Decrypt` | the parameter's key, for a `SecureString` with a customer managed key |
| `logs:CreateLogGroup`, `logs:CreateLogStream`, `logs:PutLogEvents` | its log group (`AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole`) |

Secrets Manager must be allowed to invoke the function (a resource policy for
`secretsmanager.amazonaws.com`). The function calls KMS, Secrets Manager and,
with the parameter form, SSM: in a VPC it needs endpoints or a route to them.

## Logs

One JSON object per line on stdout (`log/slog`). Each issued certificate is
logged once, with `secret_arn`, `serial` (hex), `not_after` (RFC 3339) and
`public_key_sha256` (SHA-256 of the SubjectPublicKeyInfo DER). No private key
or certificate is ever logged.
